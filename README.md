# Image Vote

Image Vote is an interactive program that allows users to blind pick between different variants from sets of images and decide which one looks better. At the end, they will be shown a ranking, with a score representing how each variant performed across all levels. The user can position the image based on the score he wants to give it. The higher the position, the higher the score.

## Features

**Drag-and-Drop Images:** You can drag the images onto the canvas and arrange them in a vertical stack according to your choice. The higher the images are, the higher score they get.

**Multiple Levels:** You can make as many levels as you want for the users to vote.

**Choose between variants:** All levels will have the same variants, but in different scenarios. For example: in the first level, you can compare how cameras **A**, **B** and **C** perform in situation **X**. In the second level, you compare those same cameras in situation **Y**.

**Ranking:** After completing all levels, you can see the final score of each variant.
